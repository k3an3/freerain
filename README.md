Semester Project for CPR E 550 (distributed systems & middleware) at Iowa State University

The goal was to basically implement a decentralized, cryptographically secure distrubuted storage system like https://storj.io/, but completely in the browser using browser-based storage (IndexedDB, filesystem API) and https://keybase.io/kbpgp.
